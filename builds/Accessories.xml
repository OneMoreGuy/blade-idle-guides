    <title>Build: Accessories</title>
    <description>
        The accessory sets below aim for a balance between DPS and survival stats. While investing in a defensive choice may seem bad in the short term, stages and dungeons will become harder, and dying is counterproductive.

        We recommend avoiding God accessories because they are not much better than Mythical accessories, and they will not last more than a month before you unlock Heaven accessories, which heavily outscale them.
