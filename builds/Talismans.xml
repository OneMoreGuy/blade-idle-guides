    <title>Build: Talismans</title>
    <description>
        Talismans are special, as they rely heavily on their Party Effect (combination) to be good. For Myth/God Rarities, don't invest in them if you can't activate the 4\* Party Effect. This guide recommends the balanced combinations, as they give around 80-90% of both damage and survival without compromising on either.

            Skip this Rarity entirely. Too expensive and is outclassed by IM Tier with low investment.

            Immortal Talismans work much like Accessories. Due to how powerful they are, Row 1 Talis can be equipped almost immediately even at the loss of the Party Effect.
