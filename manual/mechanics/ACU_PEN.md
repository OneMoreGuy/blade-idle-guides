- **ACU** affects your chance to hit an enemy. If you have less than the recommended amount, you may miss your attacks. This is scaled based on the difference between your ACU and the recommended amount. The more ACU you are behind, the higher chance you can miss.
- **PEN** affects your damage. If you have less than the recommended amount, even by 1 point, your damage is halved.

It is possible to clear content with less ACU and/or PEN than the recommended values; however, if you are below 60% of the recommended value, you will auto-fail.

For online farming, being behind ACU is worse than PEN because missing hits can and will mess up your clear time and skill rotations.
