Online requires you to keep the game open; Offline is with the game app closed.

Online farm pros and cons:
- pro: Faster clears yield more Gold, EXP, and drops.
- con: A clear time of 8s or less results in an auto-fail! Be careful with this because failing will drop your stage by 1. To combat this, push until the stage you want to farm is the last available repeatable stage.
- con: More expensive - higher electric cost and more stress on your devices.
  - Many Android players combat this annoyance by using an Android Cloud service. Not a free service.
  - For iOS players, no such luck.
- con: Skillset matters for clear speed.
- con: Chapter matters for clear speed because every chapter has a certain map setting.
  - Some maps are terrible for fast clears due to map size.
- con: Slower pushing power in stages because you need to be able to one-shot enemies.
- con: Requires constant Internet connection.

Offline farm pros and cons:
- pro: Cheaper - less electric cost and less stress on your devices.
- pro: Faster pushing power in stages.
- pro: Can use full EXP loadout because damage is not needed for offline farming.
- pro: Can ignore ACU/PEN requirements, and skillsets are irrelevant.
- con: Fixed 26 seconds per clear is much slower, meaning less total Gold, EXP, and drops.
- con: Cannot pick the stage for offline clears. Offline will always clear the second-to-last repeatable stage.

Despite the vast amount of cons with online farming, the pro outweighs the cons. Online is far superior to offline.
