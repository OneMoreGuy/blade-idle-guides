Stages in this game are broken up into two categories - repeatable and non-repeatable.
- Each chapter has 50 stages. Out of those 50 stages, only two stages are repeatable: Stage 25 and Stage 50.
  - All other stages are non-repeatable, meaning you cannot replay them after clearing them.
- The game has a limit for the amount of stages you have access to. Currently, only the last 6 repeatable stages can be replayed.
