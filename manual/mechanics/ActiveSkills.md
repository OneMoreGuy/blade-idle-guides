You can equip up to 5 skills at any given time. There are rules that determine the order in which skills are activated.

The main governing rule is:
- The skill with the higher use range is executed before skills with lower use range. See table below.
  - If multiple skills have the same range, they are executed from left to right.

If Summon Tornado is used, the rules are:
1. Any skills to the right of Summon Tornado will cast, following the main governing rule.
2. Summon Tornado will cast.
3. Any skills to the left of Summon Tornado will cast, following the main governing rule.

This is a chart of all skills and their use range.
