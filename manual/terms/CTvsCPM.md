CT (Clear Time) and CPM (Clears per Minute) are terms often used in the context of online farming. Both are efficiency metrics.

The average CT represents how quickly you can complete the stage; however, after the last enemy despawns, there is a brief lag before the next stage run starts. This lag is called transition time. Transition time is hugely dependent on the system running the game, and the time can range between 0.8s to 3.4s. The difference is quite large when CTs are around 9-10s, 3.4s transition time is over a third of the time it takes to clear a stage. This transition time is not associated with CT. For CT, lower is better.

CPM is a more accurate metric for online farming efficiency. CPM factors in both the clear time and transition time. Two different players can have the same CT, but one player may have higher CPM due to having faster transition speed. For CPM, higher is better.

Offline has no transition time. CT is at a fixed 22s, which yields ~2.7 CPM.
