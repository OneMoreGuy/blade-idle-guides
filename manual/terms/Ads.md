Advertisements is a pain for free-to-play players.

For Android players, sometimes, when you watch an ad, you get a message saying "There is no Ad to view." There is a trick to reset your ad id to get more ads (hopefully):
- Settings > Google > Ads > Reset advertising ID > Restart the game.

For iOS v14+ players, there has been no known reports of ads not showing because iOS does not send an advertisement identifier if you have "Personalized Ads" disabled:
- Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Toggle "Personalized Ads" to off > Restart the game.
