Advertisements is a pain for free-to-play players.

For Android players, sometimes, when you watch an ad, you get a message saying "There is no Ad to view." One attempt to resolve this is to remove your advertising ID:
- Settings > Google > Ads > Delete advertising ID > Restart the game.

For iOS v14+ players, there has been no known reports of ads not showing because iOS does not send an advertisement identifier if you have "Personalized Ads" disabled:
- Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Toggle "Personalized Ads" to off > Restart the game.
